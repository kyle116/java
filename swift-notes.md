# Swift Notes

## Assignment and Casting:
`let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000`

## Tuples:
Examples:

`let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")`


`let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")`
```
print("The status code is \(http200Status.statusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 200"
print("The status message is \(http200Status.description)")
// Prints "The status message is OK"
```

```
let (x, y) = (1, 2)
// x is equal to 1, and y is equal to 2
```

## Optionals
```
var surveyAnswer: String?
// surveyAnswer is automatically set to nil
```

## Optional binding
```
if let actualNumber = Int(possibleNumber) {
    print("\"\(possibleNumber)\" has an integer value of \(actualNumber)")
} else {
    print("\"\(possibleNumber)\" could not be converted to an integer")
}
// Prints ""123" has an integer value of 123"
```

## Nil-Coalescing Operator
The double question mark (double ??) Operator.
The nil-coalescing operator (a ?? b) unwraps an optional a if it contains a value, or returns a default value b if a is nil. The expression a is always of an optional type. The expression b must match the type that is stored inside a.
`(a ?? b)` is the same as `a != nil ? a! : b`


## Strings
String values can be constructed by passing an array of Character values as an argument to its initializer. (looks to work like `join()` from JavaScript):
```
let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]
let catString = String(catCharacters)
print(catString)
// Prints "Cat!üê±"
```

## Using indexes
```
let greeting = "Guten Tag!"
print(greeting[greeting.startIndex])
// G
print(greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)])
// !
print(greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)])
// u
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
greeting[index]
// a
```
```
for index in greeting.indices {
    print("\(greeting[index]) ", terminator: "")
}
// Prints "G u t e n   T a g ! "
```

## Add and remove from Strings
```
// using .insert()
var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)
// welcome now equals "hello!"

welcome.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there!"

// using .remove()
welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there"

let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -6)..<welcome.endIndex
welcome.removeSubrange(range)
// welcome now equals "hello"
```

## Substrings
When you get a substring from a string‚Äîfor example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_ :)‚Äîthe result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String. For example:
```
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
let index = greeting.index(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
let beginning = greeting[..<index]
// beginning is "Hello"

// Convert the result to a String for long-term storage.
let newString = String(beginning)
```

Like strings, each substring has a region of memory where the characters that make up the substring are stored. The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store the original string, or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring. (Strings have a similar optimization, but if two strings share memory, they are equal.) This performance optimization means you don‚Äôt have to pay the performance cost of copying memory until you modify either the string or substring. As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äîbecause they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.

In the example above, `greeting` is a string, which means it has a region of memory where the characters that make up the string are stored. Because `beginning` is a substring of `greeting`, it reuses the memory that `greeting` uses. In contrast, `newString` is a string‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs created from the substring, it has its own storage. The figure below shows these relationships:

## Collection Types
Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries

### Creating Arrays
Creating an Empty Array

You can create an empty array of a certain type using initializer syntax:
```
var someInts = [Int]()
print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
```

### Concatenating Arrays
Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together - You can create a new array by adding together two existing arrays with compatible types with the addition operator (+). The new array‚Äôs type is inferred from the type of the two arrays you add together:
```
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]

var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
```

## Array Methods
Use `.append()` to put something at the end of the array. like `.push()`

Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator (+=):
```
shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]
// shoppingList now contains 4 items
shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
```

To insert an item into the array at a specified index:
```
shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
```

To remove an item from the array at a specified index:
```
let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
```

If you want to remove the final item from an array, use the `removeLast()` method

Looping through arrays, For each item in the array, the `enumerated()` method returns a tuple composed of an integer and the item. The integers start at zero and count up by one for each item; if you enumerate over a whole array, these integers match the items‚Äô indices.  
```
for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
// Item 1: Six eggs
// Item 2: Milk
// Item 3: Flour
// Item 4: Baking Powder
// Item 5: Bananas
```

## Sets
A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.

A set type cannot be inferred from an array literal alone, so the type Set must be explicitly declared.
```
var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
```

### Fundamental Set Methods
Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the values common to both sets.

Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with values in either set, but not both.

Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with all of the values in both sets.

Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with values not in the specified set.

```
let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
// []
oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 9]
oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 2, 9]
```

Use the ‚Äúis equal‚Äù operator (`==`) to determine whether two sets contain all of the same values.

Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to determine whether all of the values of a set are contained in the specified set.

Use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to determine whether a set contains all of the values in a specified set.

Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` or `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods to determine whether a set is a subset or superset, but not equal to, a specified set.

Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to determine whether two sets have no values in common.
```
let houseAnimals: Set = ["üê∂", "üê±"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["üêÆ", "üêî", "üêë", "üê∂", "üê±"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["üê¶", "üê≠"]

houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals)
// true
```

## Dictionaries
### Creating an Empty Dictionary
As with arrays, you can create an empty Dictionary of a certain type by using initializer syntax:
```
var namesOfIntegers = [Int: String]()
// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
```

### Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal
```
var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
```

### Updating and removing dictionary values
Updating:
```
airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"
```
or
```
if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."
```

Removing:
```
airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" is not the real airport for APL, so delete it
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now been removed from the dictionary
```
or
```
if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary does not contain a value for DUB.")
}
// Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."
```

### Looping over Dictionary
```
for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
// LHR: London Heathrow
```

Loop through keys and values:
```
for airportCode in airports.keys {
    print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: YYZ
// Airport code: LHR

for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
// Airport name: London Heathrow
```

### Dictionary to Arrays
```
let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["YYZ", "LHR"]

let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
// airportNames is ["Toronto Pearson", "London Heathrow"]
```
To iterate over the keys or values of a dictionary in a specific order, use the sorted() method on its keys or values property.

## For in loops
If you dont need a value, it can be replaced with an underscore
```
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"
```
Other for in example, closed ranges/certain intervals
```
let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..<minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}

let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}

let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
```
## While Loop
`while` evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop.

`repeat-while` evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.
