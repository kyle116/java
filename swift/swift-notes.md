# Swift Notes

## Assignment and Casting:
`let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000`

### Number to string
```
var a: Double = 1.5
var b: String = String(format:"%f", a)
print("b: \(b)") // b: 1.500000
```

### Format a string
```
func formatMoney(_ val:Double) -> String {
  return String(format: "$%.2f", val)
}
print(formatMoney(3.1))
// $3.10
```

## Tuples:
Examples:

`let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")`


`let http200Status = (statusCode: 200, description: "OK")`
```
print("The status code is \(http200Status.statusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 200"
print("The status message is \(http200Status.description)")
// Prints "The status message is OK"
```

```
let (x, y) = (1, 2)
// x is equal to 1, and y is equal to 2

let tup = (2, 3)

print(tup.0)
// prints 2
```

## Optionals
```
var surveyAnswer: String?
// surveyAnswer is automatically set to nil
```

## Optional binding
```
if let actualNumber = Int(possibleNumber) {
    print("\"\(possibleNumber)\" has an integer value of \(actualNumber)")
} else {
    print("\"\(possibleNumber)\" could not be converted to an integer")
}
// Prints ""123" has an integer value of 123"
```

## Nil-Coalescing Operator
The double question mark (double `??`) Operator.
The nil-coalescing operator (`a ?? b`) unwraps an optional a if it contains a value, or returns a default value b if a is nil. The expression a is always of an optional type. The expression `b` must match the type that is stored inside `a`.
`(a ?? b)` is the same as `a != nil ? a! : b`


## Strings
String values can be constructed by passing an array of Character values as an argument to its initializer. (looks to work like `join()` from JavaScript):
```
let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "üê±"]
let catString = String(catCharacters)
print(catString)
// Prints "Cat!üê±"
```

## Using indexes
```
let greeting = "Guten Tag!"
print(greeting[greeting.startIndex])
// G
print(greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)])
// !
print(greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)])
// u
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
greeting[index]
// a
```
```
for index in greeting.indices {
    print("\(greeting[index]) ", terminator: "")
}
// Prints "G u t e n   T a g ! "
```

## Add and remove from Strings
```
// using .insert()
var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)
// welcome now equals "hello!"

welcome.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there!"

// using .remove()
welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there"

let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -6)..<welcome.endIndex
welcome.removeSubrange(range)
// welcome now equals "hello"
```

## Substrings
When you get a substring from a string‚Äîfor example, using a subscript or a method like prefix(_ :)‚Äîthe result is an instance of Substring, not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you‚Äôre ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of String. For example:
```
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
let index = greeting.index(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
let beginning = greeting[..<index]
// beginning is "Hello"

// Convert the result to a String for long-term storage.
let newString = String(beginning)
```

Like strings, each substring has a region of memory where the characters that make up the substring are stored. The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store the original string, or part of the memory that‚Äôs used to store another substring. (Strings have a similar optimization, but if two strings share memory, they are equal.) This performance optimization means you don‚Äôt have to pay the performance cost of copying memory until you modify either the string or substring. As mentioned above, substrings aren‚Äôt suitable for long-term storage‚Äîbecause they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.

In the example above, `greeting` is a string, which means it has a region of memory where the characters that make up the string are stored. Because `beginning` is a substring of `greeting`, it reuses the memory that `greeting` uses. In contrast, `newString` is a string‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs created from the substring, it has its own storage. The figure below shows these relationships:

## Collection Types
Swift provides three primary collection types, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries

### Creating Arrays
Creating an Empty Array

You can create an empty array of a certain type using initializer syntax:
```
var someInts = [Int]()
print("someInts is of type [Int] with \(someInts.count) items.")
// Prints "someInts is of type [Int] with 0 items."
```

### Concatenating Arrays
Creating an Array by Adding Two Arrays Together - You can create a new array by adding together two existing arrays with compatible types with the addition operator (+). The new array‚Äôs type is inferred from the type of the two arrays you add together:
```
var anotherThreeDoubles = Array(repeating: 2.5, count: 3)
// anotherThreeDoubles is of type [Double], and equals [2.5, 2.5, 2.5]

var sixDoubles = threeDoubles + anotherThreeDoubles
// sixDoubles is inferred as [Double], and equals [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5]
```

## Array Methods
Use `.append()` to put something at the end of the array. like `.push()`

Alternatively, append an array of one or more compatible items with the addition assignment operator (+=):
```
shoppingList += ["Baking Powder"]
// shoppingList now contains 4 items
shoppingList += ["Chocolate Spread", "Cheese", "Butter"]
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
```

To insert an item into the array at a specified index:
```
shoppingList.insert("Maple Syrup", at: 0)
// shoppingList now contains 7 items
// "Maple Syrup" is now the first item in the list
```

To remove an item from the array at a specified index:
```
let mapleSyrup = shoppingList.remove(at: 0)
// the item that was at index 0 has just been removed
// shoppingList now contains 6 items, and no Maple Syrup
// the mapleSyrup constant is now equal to the removed "Maple Syrup" string
```

If you want to remove the final item from an array, use the `removeLast()` method

Looping through arrays, For each item in the array, the `enumerated()` method returns a tuple composed of an integer and the item. The integers start at zero and count up by one for each item; if you enumerate over a whole array, these integers match the items‚Äô indices.  
```
for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() {
    print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)")
}
// Item 1: Six eggs
// Item 2: Milk
// Item 3: Flour
// Item 4: Baking Powder
// Item 5: Bananas
```

## Sets
A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering.

A set type cannot be inferred from an array literal alone, so the type Set must be explicitly declared.
```
var favoriteGenres: Set = ["Rock", "Classical", "Hip hop"]
```

### Fundamental Set Methods
Use the `intersection(_:)` method to create a new set with only the values common to both sets.

Use the `symmetricDifference(_:)` method to create a new set with values in either set, but not both.

Use the `union(_:)` method to create a new set with all of the values in both sets.

Use the `subtracting(_:)` method to create a new set with values not in the specified set.

```
let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]

oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
// []
oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 9]
oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 2, 9]
```

Use the ‚Äúis equal‚Äù operator (`==`) to determine whether two sets contain all of the same values.

Use the `isSubset(of:)` method to determine whether all of the values of a set are contained in the specified set.

Use the `isSuperset(of:)` method to determine whether a set contains all of the values in a specified set.

Use the `isStrictSubset(of:)` or `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods to determine whether a set is a subset or superset, but not equal to, a specified set.

Use the `isDisjoint(with:)` method to determine whether two sets have no values in common.
```
let houseAnimals: Set = ["üê∂", "üê±"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["üêÆ", "üêî", "üêë", "üê∂", "üê±"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["üê¶", "üê≠"]

houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals)
// true
```

## Dictionaries
### Creating an Empty Dictionary
As with arrays, you can create an empty Dictionary of a certain type by using initializer syntax:
```
var namesOfIntegers = [Int: String]()
// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
```

### Creating a Dictionary with a Dictionary Literal
```
var airports: [String: String] = ["YYZ": "Toronto Pearson", "DUB": "Dublin"]
```

### Updating and removing dictionary values
Updating:
```
airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"
// the value for "LHR" has been changed to "London Heathrow"
```
or
```
if let oldValue = airports.updateValue("Dublin Airport", forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The old value for DUB was \(oldValue).")
}
// Prints "The old value for DUB was Dublin."
```

Removing:
```
airports["APL"] = "Apple International"
// "Apple International" is not the real airport for APL, so delete it
airports["APL"] = nil
// APL has now been removed from the dictionary
```
or
```
if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
    print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
} else {
    print("The airports dictionary does not contain a value for DUB.")
}
// Prints "The removed airport's name is Dublin Airport."
```

### Looping over Dictionary
```
for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
// LHR: London Heathrow
```

Loop through keys and values:
```
for airportCode in airports.keys {
    print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: YYZ
// Airport code: LHR

for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
// Airport name: London Heathrow
```

### Dictionary to Arrays
```
let airportCodes = [String](airports.keys)
// airportCodes is ["YYZ", "LHR"]

let airportNames = [String](airports.values)
// airportNames is ["Toronto Pearson", "London Heathrow"]
```
To iterate over the keys or values of a dictionary in a specific order, use the sorted() method on its keys or values property.

## For in loops
If you dont need a value, it can be replaced with an underscore
```
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"
```
Other for in example, closed ranges/certain intervals
```
let minutes = 60
for tickMark in 0..<minutes {
    // render the tick mark each minute (60 times)
}

let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}

let hours = 12
let hourInterval = 3
for tickMark in stride(from: 3, through: hours, by: hourInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 3 hours (3, 6, 9, 12)
}
```
## While Loop
`while` evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop.

`repeat-while` evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.

## Switch Statements
`switch` statements in Swift do not fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one by default. Instead, the entire switch statement finishes its execution as soon as the first matching switch case is completed, without requiring an explicit break statement.

To make a switch with a single case that matches both "a" and "A", combine the two values into a compound case, separating the values with commas.
```
let anotherCharacter: Character = "a"
switch anotherCharacter {
case "a", "A":
    print("The letter A")
default:
    print("Not the letter A")
}
// Prints "The letter A"
```

### Tuples with switch statements
```
let somePoint = (1, 1)
switch somePoint {
case (0, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is at the origin")
case (_, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the x-axis")
case (0, _):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the y-axis")
case (-2...2, -2...2):
    print("\(somePoint) is inside the box")
default:
    print("\(somePoint) is outside of the box")
}
// Prints "(1, 1) is inside the box"
```

### Where clause on switch
```
let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint {
case let (x, y) where x == y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == y")
case let (x, y) where x == -y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == -y")
case let (x, y):
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is just some arbitrary point")
}
// Prints "(1, -1) is on the line x == -y"
```

### Control transfer statements
`fallthrough` allows for a switch statement to continue down into the next case
```
let integerToDescribe = 5
var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
switch integerToDescribe {
case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
    description += " a prime number, and also"
    fallthrough
default:
    description += " an integer."
}
print(description)
// Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."
```

### Labeled Statements
Swift allows for labeled loops and conditional statements. They all use `break` and `continue` so to clear up which loop or conditional, you can label them
```
gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    switch square + diceRoll {
    case finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
        break gameLoop // Labeled here
    case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
        continue gameLoop // Labeled here
    default:
        // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
        square += diceRoll
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
```

## Guard Statements
Guard statement is similar to an if statement in a sense that it operates based on a boolean. Guard statements require an `else` clause as well.  
```
func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }

    print("Hello \(name)!")

    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }

    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}

greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."
````

## Checking API Availability
```
if #available(iOS 10, macOS 10.12, *) {
    // Use iOS 10 APIs on iOS, and use macOS 10.12 APIs on macOS
} else {
    // Fall back to earlier iOS and macOS APIs
}
```
The availability condition above specifies that in iOS, the body of the if statement executes only in iOS 10 and later; in macOS, only in macOS 10.12 and later. The last argument, `*` , is required and specifies that on any other platform, the body of the if executes on the minimum deployment target specified by your target.

## Functions
All functions are prefixed with `func`. After the `->` is the function's return type. Functions are not required to have return values therefore if there is not return, just remove the `->` and type after. Functions and methods with no return type have an implicit return type of `Void`. This means that they return a value of `()`, or an empty tuple.
```
func greet(person: String, alreadyGreeted: Bool) -> String {
    if alreadyGreeted {
        return greetAgain(person: person)
    } else {
        return greet(person: person)
    }
}
print(greet(person: "Tim", alreadyGreeted: true))
// Prints "Hello again, Tim!"

```

Returning a tuple from a function. Example of optional tuple (note the ? at the end of the return types). Will return nil if no values
```
func minMax(array: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int)? {
    if array.isEmpty { return nil }
    var currentMin = array[0]
    var currentMax = array[0]
    for value in array[1..<array.count] {
        if value < currentMin {
            currentMin = value
        } else if value > currentMax {
            currentMax = value
        }
    }
    return (currentMin, currentMax)
}
```

### Labeled parameters for functions
In the function, `hometown` is used when creating the function but `from` is used when calling the function
```
func greet(person: String, from hometown: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person)!  Glad you could visit from \(hometown)."
}
print(greet(person: "Bill", from: "Cupertino"))
// Prints "Hello Bill!  Glad you could visit from Cupertino."
```

If you don‚Äôt want an argument label for a parameter, write an underscore (`_`) instead of an explicit argument label for that parameter.
```
func someFunction(_ firstParameterName: Int, secondParameterName: Int) {
    // In the function body, firstParameterName and secondParameterName
    // refer to the argument values for the first and second parameters.
}
someFunction(1, secondParameterName: 2)
```

### Default parameters
Place parameters that don‚Äôt have default values at the beginning of a function‚Äôs parameter list, before the parameters that have default values.
```
func someFunction(parameterWithoutDefault: Int, parameterWithDefault: Int = 12) {
    // If you omit the second argument when calling this function, then
    // the value of parameterWithDefault is 12 inside the function body.
}
someFunction(parameterWithoutDefault: 3, parameterWithDefault: 6) // parameterWithDefault is 6
someFunction(parameterWithoutDefault: 4) // parameterWithDefault is 12
```

### Variadic Parameters
A variadic parameter accepts zero or more values of a specified type. You use a variadic parameter to specify that the parameter can be passed a varying number of input values when the function is called. The values passed to a variadic parameter are made available within the function‚Äôs body as an array of the appropriate type.
```
func arithmeticMean(_ numbers: Double...) -> Double {
    var total: Double = 0
    for number in numbers {
        total += number
    }
    return total / Double(numbers.count)
}
arithmeticMean(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// returns 3.0, which is the arithmetic mean of these five numbers
arithmeticMean(3, 8.25, 18.75)
// returns 10.0, which is the arithmetic mean of these three numbers
```

### In-Out Parameters
Function parameters are constants by default. `inout` parameters allows you to make changes to parameters. Declare this in the parameter before the parameter type
```
func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int) {
    let temporaryA = a
    a = b
    b = temporaryA
}
```

### Function as types
This can be read as:
‚ÄúDefine a variable called `mathFunction`, which has a type of a `function` that takes two `Int` values, and returns an `Int` value. Set this new variable to refer to the function called `addTwoInts`.‚Äù
`var mathFunction: (Int, Int) -> Int = addTwoInts`

You can also leave swift to infer the type for you
```
let anotherMathFunction = addTwoInts
// anotherMathFunction is inferred to be of type (Int, Int) -> Int
```

### Function type as parameter type
```
func printMathResult(_ mathFunction: (Int, Int) -> Int, _ a: Int, _ b: Int) {
    print("Result: \(mathFunction(a, b))")
}
printMathResult(addTwoInts, 3, 5)
// Prints "Result: 8"
```

### Function type as return type
```
func stepForward(_ input: Int) -> Int {
    return input + 1
}
func stepBackward(_ input: Int) -> Int {
    return input - 1
}
```
Here‚Äôs a function called `chooseStepFunction(backward:)`, whose return type is `(Int) -> Int`. The `chooseStepFunction(backward:)` function returns the `stepForward(_:)` function or the `stepBackward(_:)` function based on a Boolean parameter called backward:
```
func chooseStepFunction(backward: Bool) -> (Int) -> Int {
    return backward ? stepBackward : stepForward
}
```
You can now use `chooseStepFunction(backward:)` to obtain a function that will step in one direction or the other:
```
var currentValue = 3
let moveNearerToZero = chooseStepFunction(backward: currentValue > 0)
// moveNearerToZero now refers to the stepBackward() function
```
The example above determines whether a positive or negative step is needed to move a variable called `currentValue` progressively closer to zero. `currentValue` has an initial value of `3`, which means that `currentValue > 0` returns `true`, causing `chooseStepFunction(backward:)` to return the `stepBackward(_:)` function. A reference to the returned function is stored in a constant called `moveNearerToZero`.

Now that `moveNearerToZero` refers to the correct function, it can be used to count to zero:
```
print("Counting to zero:")
// Counting to zero:
while currentValue != 0 {
    print("\(currentValue)... ")
    currentValue = moveNearerToZero(currentValue)
}
print("zero!")
// 3...
// 2...
// 1...
// zero!
```

## Sorted Method
Takes a function and works similarly to sort from JavaScript. It can be written this way
```
let names = ["Chris", "Alex", "Ewa", "Barry", "Daniella"]
func backward(_ s1: String, _ s2: String) -> Bool {
    return s1 > s2
}
var reversedNames = names.sorted(by: backward)
// reversedNames is equal to ["Ewa", "Daniella", "Chris", "Barry", "Alex"]
```
Or:
```
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { (s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool in
    return s1 > s2
})
```
Or:
```
reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { (s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool in return s1 > s2 } )
```


## Closures
### Capturing values
```
func makeIncrementer(forIncrement amount: Int) -> () -> Int {
    var runningTotal = 0
    func incrementer() -> Int {
        runningTotal += amount
        return runningTotal
    }
    return incrementer
}

let incrementByTen = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 10)

incrementByTen()
// returns a value of 10
incrementByTen()
// returns a value of 20
incrementByTen()
// returns a value of 30
```

### Closures Are Reference Types
```
let alsoIncrementByTen = incrementByTen
alsoIncrementByTen()
// returns a value of 40
```

### Keywords for closures
`@autoclosure` and `@escaping`

## Enumeration Syntax
You introduce enumerations with the enum keyword and place their entire definition within a pair of braces:
```
enum SomeEnumeration {
    // enumeration definition goes here
}

enum Barcode {
    case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int)
    case qrCode(String)
}
var productBarcode = Barcode.upc(8, 85909, 51226, 3)
productBarcode = .qrCode("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP") // since productBarcode has already been defined as a Barcode, you can just do a .notation

// use in a switch statement
switch productBarcode {
case let .upc(numberSystem, manufacturer, product, check):
    print("UPC : \(numberSystem), \(manufacturer), \(product), \(check).")
case let .qrCode(productCode):
    print("QR code: \(productCode).")
}
```

### Enumeration raw values
```
enum Planet: Int {
    case mercury = 1, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune
}
enum CompassPoint: String {
    case north, south, east, west
}

let earthsOrder = Planet.earth.rawValue
// earthsOrder is 3

let sunsetDirection = CompassPoint.west.rawValue
// sunsetDirection is "west"
```
Trying to access enumeration raw values that do not exist:
```
let positionToFind = 11
if let somePlanet = Planet(rawValue: positionToFind) {
    switch somePlanet {
    case .earth:
        print("Mostly harmless")
    default:
        print("Not a safe place for humans")
    }
} else {
    print("There isn't a planet at position \(positionToFind)")
}
// Prints "There isn't a planet at position 11"
```

### Recursive Enumerations
You indicate that an enumeration case is recursive by writing `indirect` before it, which tells the compiler to insert the necessary layer of indirection.
```
enum ArithmeticExpression {
    case number(Int)
    indirect case addition(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
    indirect case multiplication(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
}
```
Or
```
indirect enum ArithmeticExpression {
    case number(Int)
    case addition(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
    case multiplication(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
}
```

Example:
```
let five = ArithmeticExpression.number(5)
let four = ArithmeticExpression.number(4)
let sum = ArithmeticExpression.addition(five, four)
let product = ArithmeticExpression.multiplication(sum, ArithmeticExpression.number(2))
```

## Classes and Structures
Declaring a class and structure:
```
class SomeClass {
    // class definition goes here
}
struct SomeStructure {
    // structure definition goes here
}
```

Initialization:
```
let vga = Resolution(width: 640, height: 480)
```

### Classes Are Reference Types
You can check classes if they refer to the same reference type with the Triple Equal sign `===`
‚ÄúIdentical to‚Äù `===` means that two constants or variables of class type refer to exactly the same class instance.

‚ÄúEqual to‚Äù `==` means that two instances are considered ‚Äúequal‚Äù or ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù in value, for some appropriate meaning of ‚Äúequal‚Äù, as defined by the type‚Äôs designer.

## Lazy stored properties
```
class DataImporter {
    /*
     DataImporter is a class to import data from an external file.
     The class is assumed to take a nontrivial amount of time to initialize.
     */
    var filename = "data.txt"
    // the DataImporter class would provide data importing functionality here
}

class DataManager {
    lazy var importer = DataImporter()
    var data = [String]()
    // the DataManager class would provide data management functionality here
}

let manager = DataManager()
manager.data.append("Some data")
manager.data.append("Some more data")
// the DataImporter instance for the importer property has not yet been created
```

Because `importer` is marked with the `lazy` modifier, the `DataImporter` instance for the importer property is only created when the importer property is first accessed, such as when its filename property is queried:
```
print(manager.importer.filename)
// the DataImporter instance for the importer property has now been created
// Prints "data.txt"
```

## Computed Properties
```
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}
struct Size {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0
}
struct Rect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    var center: Point {
        get {
            let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
            let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
            return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
        }
        set(newCenter) {
            origin.x = newCenter.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newCenter.y - (size.height / 2)
        }
    }
}
var square = Rect(origin: Point(x: 0.0, y: 0.0),
                  size: Size(width: 10.0, height: 10.0))
let initialSquareCenter = square.center
square.center = Point(x: 15.0, y: 15.0)
print("square.origin is now at (\(square.origin.x), \(square.origin.y))")
// Prints "square.origin is now at (10.0, 10.0)"
```
Getter and Setter methods.
A computed property with a getter but no setter is known as a read-only computed property.

## Type Property
You define type properties with the `static` keyword. For computed type properties for class types, you can use the class keyword instead to allow subclasses to override the superclass‚Äôs implementation. The example below shows the syntax for stored and computed type properties:
```
struct SomeStructure {
    static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
    static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 1
    }
}
enum SomeEnumeration {
    static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
    static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 6
    }
}
class SomeClass {
    static var storedTypeProperty = "Some value."
    static var computedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 27
    }
    class var overrideableComputedTypeProperty: Int {
        return 107
    }
}
```

## Self
Without the self prefix, Swift would assume that both uses of x referred to the method parameter called x.
```
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    func isToTheRightOf(x: Double) -> Bool {
        return self.x > x
    }
}
let somePoint = Point(x: 4.0, y: 5.0)
if somePoint.isToTheRightOf(x: 1.0) {
    print("This point is to the right of the line where x == 1.0")
}
// Prints "This point is to the right of the line where x == 1.0"
```

## Modifying Value Types from Within Instance Methods
Mutating values within `struct`
You can opt in to this behavior by placing the `mutating` keyword before the `func` keyword for that method:
```
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    mutating func moveBy(x deltaX: Double, y deltaY: Double) {
        x += deltaX
        y += deltaY
    }
}
var somePoint = Point(x: 1.0, y: 1.0)
somePoint.moveBy(x: 2.0, y: 3.0)
print("The point is now at (\(somePoint.x), \(somePoint.y))")
// Prints "The point is now at (3.0, 4.0)"
```
Another way using self:
```
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
    mutating func moveBy(x deltaX: Double, y deltaY: Double) {
        self = Point(x: x + deltaX, y: y + deltaY)
    }
}
```

## Override methods from other classes
As you can see in the `ViewController.swift` file, the template‚Äôs implementation overrides both the `viewDidLoad()` and `didReceiveMemoryWarning()` methods using the `override` key word
```
class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
    }

    // didReceiveMemoryWarning() method not shown
}
```

## Initialization and deinitialization
```
class Player {
    var coinsInPurse: Int
    init(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse = Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    func win(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse += Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    deinit {
        Bank.receive(coins: coinsInPurse)
    }
}

var playerOne: Player? = Player(coins: 100)
print("A new player has joined the game with \(playerOne!.coinsInPurse) coins")
// Prints "A new player has joined the game with 100 coins"
print("There are now \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins left in the bank")
// Prints "There are now 9900 coins left in the bank"

playerOne = nil
print("PlayerOne has left the game")
// Prints "PlayerOne has left the game"
print("The bank now has \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins")
// Prints "The bank now has 10000 coins"
```
The player has now left the game. This is indicated by setting the optional `playerOne` variable to `nil`, meaning ‚Äúno Player instance.‚Äù At the point that this happens, the `playerOne` variable‚Äôs reference to the Player instance is broken. No other properties or variables are still referring to the Player instance, and so it is deallocated in order to free up its memory. Just before this happens, its deinitializer is called automatically, and its coins are returned to the bank.

## Setting a property with closure or function
The `boardColors` array is created due to the parentheses after the closure `{}()`
```
struct Chessboard {
    let boardColors: [Bool] = {
        var temporaryBoard = [Bool]()
        var isBlack = false
        for i in 1...8 {
            for j in 1...8 {
                temporaryBoard.append(isBlack)
                isBlack = !isBlack
            }
            isBlack = !isBlack
        }
        return temporaryBoard
    }()
    func squareIsBlackAt(row: Int, column: Int) -> Bool {
        return boardColors[(row * 8) + column]
    }
}
```

## Accessing Subscripts of Optional Type
The example defines a dictionary called `testScores`, which contains two key-value pairs that map a `String` key to an array of `Int` values. The example uses optional chaining to set the first item in the `"Dave"` array to `91`; to increment the first item in the `"Bev"` array by `1`; and to try to set the first item in an array for a key of `"Brian"`. The first two calls succeed, because the `testScores` dictionary contains keys for `"Dave"` and `"Bev"`. The third call fails, because the `testScores` dictionary does not contain a key for `"Brian"`.
```
var testScores = ["Dave": [86, 82, 84], "Bev": [79, 94, 81]]
testScores["Dave"]?[0] = 91
testScores["Bev"]?[0] += 1
testScores["Brian"]?[0] = 72
// the "Dave" array is now [91, 82, 84] and the "Bev" array is now [80, 94, 81]
```

## Error Handling
Error Syntax:
```
enum VendingMachineError: Error {
    case invalidSelection
    case insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: Int)
    case outOfStock
}
throw VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: 5)
```

## Downcasting
In this example, each item in the array might be a Movie, or it might be a Song. You don‚Äôt know in advance which actual class to use for each item, and so it is appropriate to use the conditional form of the type cast operator (`as?`) to check the downcast each time through the loop:
```
for item in library {
    if let movie = item as? Movie {
        print("Movie: \(movie.name), dir. \(movie.director)")
    } else if let song = item as? Song {
        print("Song: \(song.name), by \(song.artist)")
    }
}
```

## Type Casting for Any and AnyObject
Swift provides two special types for working with nonspecific types:
* Any can represent an instance of any type at all, including function types.
* AnyObject can represent an instance of any class type.
Here‚Äôs an example of using Any to work with a mix of different types, including function types and nonclass types. The example creates an array called things, which can store values of type Any:
```
var things = [Any]()

things.append(0)
things.append(0.0)
things.append(42)
things.append(3.14159)
things.append("hello")
things.append((3.0, 5.0))
things.append(Movie(name: "Ghostbusters", director: "Ivan Reitman"))
things.append({ (name: String) -> String in "Hello, \(name)" })
```

To discover the specific type of a constant or variable that is known only to be of type Any or AnyObject, you can use an is or as pattern in a switch statement‚Äôs cases. The example below iterates over the items in the things array and queries the type of each item with a switch statement. Several of the switch statement‚Äôs cases bind their matched value to a constant of the specified type to enable its value to be printed:
```
for thing in things {
    switch thing {
    case 0 as Int:
        print("zero as an Int")
    case 0 as Double:
        print("zero as a Double")
    case let someInt as Int:
        print("an integer value of \(someInt)")
    case let someDouble as Double where someDouble > 0:
        print("a positive double value of \(someDouble)")
    case is Double:
        print("some other double value that I don't want to print")
    case let someString as String:
        print("a string value of \"\(someString)\"")
    case let (x, y) as (Double, Double):
        print("an (x, y) point at \(x), \(y)")
    case let movie as Movie:
        print("a movie called \(movie.name), dir. \(movie.director)")
    case let stringConverter as (String) -> String:
        print(stringConverter("Michael"))
    default:
        print("something else")
    }
}

// zero as an Int
// zero as a Double
// an integer value of 42
// a positive double value of 3.14159
// a string value of "hello"
// an (x, y) point at 3.0, 5.0
// a movie called Ghostbusters, dir. Ivan Reitman
// Hello, Michael
```

## Generic Types
`T` represents a placeholder type. The placeholder type name doesn‚Äôt say anything about what `T` must be, but it does say that both `a` and `b` must be of the same type `T`, whatever `T` represents. The brackets `<T>` tell Swift that T is a placeholder type name within the `swapTwoValues(_:_:)` function definition. The placeholder can be named anything, does not have to be `T`
```
func swapTwoInts(_ a: inout Int, _ b: inout Int) // Non Generic
func swapTwoValues<T>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) // Generic Type
```

The first type parameter, T, has a type constraint that requires T to be a subclass of SomeClass. The second type parameter, U, has a type constraint that requires U to conform to the protocol SomeProtocol.
```
func someFunction<T: SomeClass, U: SomeProtocol>(someT: T, someU: U) {
    // function body goes here
}
```
